# Touchpad Gesture Improvements

This extension modifies and extends existing touchpad gestures on GNOME.
This is a fork of [gnome-gesture-improvemnets](https://github.com/harshadgavali/gnome-gesture-improvements) but fixed to work for Gnome 47/48 (since the original creator seems to not be active anymore)

## Installation
### From GNOME Extensions Website
<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4245/gesture-improvements/">
<img src="https://github.com/andyholmes/gnome-shell-extensions-badge/raw/master/get-it-on-ego.svg" alt="Get it on EGO" width="200" />
</a>

### Manually
1. Install extension
```
git clone https://github.com/harshadgavali/gnome-gesture-improvements.git/
cd gnome-gesture-improvements
npm install
npm run update
```
2. Log out and log in **or** just restart session (X11)
3. Enable extension via extensions app or via command line
```
gnome-extensions enable gestureImprovements@gestures
```

### Additional app X11
On X11, you also need to install [gnome-x11-gesture-daemon](https://github.com/zara2x/gnome-x11-gesture-daemon)

| Pinch Gesture | Modes   | Fingers |

| Show Desktop  | Desktop | 3/4     |

| Application Gestures (Configurable) |
| :--- |
| Go back or forward in browser tab |
| Switch to next or previous image in image viewer |
| Switch to next or previous audio |
| Change tabs |

#### For activating tiling gesture (inverted T gesture)
1. Do a 3-finger vertical downward gesture on a unmaximized window
2. Wait a few milliseconds
3. Do a 3-finger horizontal gesture to tile a window to either side

#### Notes
* Minimize gesture is available if you have dash-to-dock/panel or similar extension enabled.
* To activate application gesture, hold for few moments(configurable) before swiping
* Tiling gesture can't be activated if you enable minimize gesture


## Customization
* To switch to windows from *all* workspaces using 3-fingers swipes, run 
```
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.window-switcher current-workspace-only false
```

* Add delay to alt-tab gesture, to ensure second windows gets selected when a fast swipe is done
* Change sensitivity of swipe (touchpad swipe speed)
* Option to follow natural scrolling (seperate from option in GNOME settings)
* Revert to 3-finger swipes to switch workspace on desktop (4-fingers to switch windows)
* Revert to 3-finger swipes for overview navigation (4-fingers to maximize/unmaximize/tile)
